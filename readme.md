## Code Challenge

Build a REST api that uses the `data.json` file as your data store.

You can use any PHP framework/packages to accomplish this challenge. We are looking more at your approach rather than the end result.

## Requirements

The API will need to have the following abilities:

- Show all records
- Create new record
- Find and show one record based on `id`
- Update existing record based on `id`
- Delete existing record based on `id`
