## Code Challenge

Build a REST api that uses the `data.json` file as your data store.

You can use any PHP or Node framework/packages to accomplish this challenge. 

We are looking more at your approach rather than the end result.

## Requirements

The API will need to have the following abilities:

- Show all records
- Create new record
- Find and show one record based on `id`
- Update existing record based on `id`
- Delete existing record based on `id`
- Have a Dockerfile and docker-compose file to run the project.
